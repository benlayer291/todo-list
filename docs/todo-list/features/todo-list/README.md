# Todo list

**Last updated:** 2026-06-30 — ENG-358
**Status:** Complete

---

## What it is
A single-user, client-side todo list. The user can view their tasks (each with a text label and a done/not-done state) in the browser, with tasks persisted locally so they survive a reload. The full feature offers five actions — view, add, remove, edit text, and toggle done — delivered incrementally across tasks.

As of ENG-358, all five actions are implemented: the app loads and renders persisted tasks, the user can **add** a new (not-done) task via the form, **remove** any task via its per-row Remove control, **edit** a task's text by double-clicking it, and **toggle** a task done/not-done via its checkbox. The feature is complete.

## Why it exists
Gives a single user a simple place to track tasks in the browser, with no accounts, backend, or sync. (The wider project also serves as a vehicle for exercising the engineering workflow end-to-end.)

**User story:** View tasks (plus Add, Remove, Edit, Toggle, Persistence — incremental)
**PRD:** `docs/todo-list/prd.output.md`
**Linear project:** https://linear.app/rotate/project/todo-list-737f7d905efa

## How it works
Container/presentation split with a pure data core:

**Components:**
- `src/tasks.js` — pure data module: `Task` shape, `localStorage` I/O, and immutable operations (ENG-353).
- `src/ui.js` — DOM layer: `renderTasks` (presentation) and `mountApp` (container).
- `src/main.js` — bootstrap: mounts the app on `DOMContentLoaded`.
- `index.html` — static shell: heading, add form, and `#task-list` render root (ENG-352).

**Data flow:**
On load, `mountApp` calls `loadTasks()` (reads `localStorage['todo-list.tasks']`, `[]` if absent/invalid) and `renderTasks` paints one `<li>` per task into `#task-list`. `mountApp` holds the current list in scope; a user action calls a pure operation → `saveTasks` → full re-render. As of ENG-355 the add form's `submit` is wired: `addTask(tasks, input.value)` → persist → re-render → clear input (empty/whitespace rejected by `addTask`). As of ENG-356, removal is wired via a single delegated `click` listener on the root: a `.remove` button click → read the row's `data-id` → `removeTask` → persist → re-render. As of ENG-357, editing is wired via a delegated `dblclick`: double-clicking a `.task-text` swaps it for a transient input; on blur/Enter → `editTask(id, value)` → persist → re-render (Escape cancels; empty text rejected by `editTask`). As of ENG-358, the done checkbox is wired via a delegated `change`: toggling `.toggle` → read the row's `data-id` → `toggleTask` → persist → re-render.

**Key functions:**
- `renderTasks(tasks, root)` in `src/ui.js` — clears the root and rebuilds one `<li>` per task (text via `textContent`, done state via a checkbox + `done` class, row tagged with `data-id`).
- `mountApp(root)` in `src/ui.js` — loads persisted tasks and renders them; the seam later tasks extend with event handlers.

## Acceptance criteria (View tasks — ENG-354)

**Scenario:** List renders existing tasks
```gherkin
Given stored tasks "Buy milk" (not-done) and "Call Sam" (done)
When the app mounts
Then "Buy milk" is shown as not-done and "Call Sam" is shown as done
```

**Scenario:** Empty list
```gherkin
Given no stored tasks
When the app mounts
Then the task list is empty and no error occurs
```

## Known limitations
- Single user, single browser; no accounts, sharing, or cross-device sync.
- Out of scope (PRD): due dates, priorities, multiple lists, tags, filtering/sorting, search, reordering.
